# NKU Project Repo - Grocery List

This will be a simple Grocery List application that is accessible online and will have user login session management that will keep track of each user's lists. The app will support users adding, deleting and categorizing items on the fly (refreshing the page). 

To use:

* Type the name of the item you want to add in the text field (eg. bananas)
* Click the 'add' button
* Your item was added to your list! 
* To delete, simply click the 'delete' link next to the item you want to delete.
